[Starting]
In this project I am going to create a simple recipes website using html primarily using the
linking function of html <a> to make the website interactive.

This would be my first project for TOP and so far I am learning a lot especially how github works.

[Finishing]
In this project I have learned to link through multiple pages and have a very simple interactive website that 
links to one another.

It was very fun and quite simple and I would really like to do more projects in this course.
